# Swift Weather App 

The app for now is quite simple, it demonstrates the current weather based on user location, and it has a very simple UI too.
This will remain usable until the API key I was given expires, I'll update it whenever it's necessary. 

I created this App to further my learning in Mobile Development, it's not the most downloaded app on the App Store, but it's 
a fun way to see that I can build more than usable stuff myself.

# Development Environment

I used Xcode for the first time with my MacBook, I need to admit, that I haven't had a very easy transition with Xcode, since 
it consumes a lot of energy on my computer, even being Apple's latest computer, so I know there's a lot of room for improvement 
there. 

I used Swift, of course, there are so many methods and libraries already built it! It's amazing, I used the CoreLocation only, which
allows me to get access to the user's location as long as he/she gives me permission to obtain it. 
I need to say that Swift is very smart, I would love to be proficient in it.

# Enhancements for the future.

* Have a whole 10-day forecast as soon as I can get a good API that helps me with it. 
* Have notifications for snow, storms, winds, and many other events that might occur during the day.
* I would like it to have animations to make the experience much richer.
